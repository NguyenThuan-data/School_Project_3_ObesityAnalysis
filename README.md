# 📊 Obesity Analysis Project

## Project Overview

The project aims to investigate the relationship between lifestyle factors and obesity levels.
The project uses the 'Dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico'. The project seeks to answer the question:
* What dietary habits and daily living habits are significantly affected obesity levels?

## 📈 Key Findings
The report identifies several factors that significantly affect obesity levels:

* Eating behaviors:
    * Eating snacks between meals (CAEC)
    * Frequency of vegetable consumption (FCVC)
    * Consumption of high-calorie foods (FAVC)
* Daily routines:
    * Screen time (TUE)
    * Physical activity (FAF)

---

## 🔍 Insights
The report suggests that interventions aimed at reducing obesity should focus on promoting physical activity, reducing snacking, increasing vegetable intake, and limiting sedentary behavior.

---

## Limitation
The report assumes that participants accurately reported their dietary intake and daily living habits. This assumption may not hold true, as individuals may underreport unhealthy habits or overestimate healthy ones.

---

## Potential Improvement
The report could explore non-linear relationships between variables. While the report identifies several factors that significantly affect obesity levels, it primarily focuses on linear relationships. Exploring potential non-linear relationships between these variables and obesity levels could provide a more nuanced understanding of the contributing factors.
